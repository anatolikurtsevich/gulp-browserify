Gulp/Browserify/Angular/Less web-starter
===============

Possible gulp tasks:
- clean (remove build directory)
- less (compile less / you need to specify environment first)
- scripts (compile all JavaScript into one file)
- templates (compile angular templates and push it to angular templateCache)
- uglify (uglify built scripts / run 'scripts' first)
- watch

CI:
- build:(dev/prod/stage)
- serve:(dev/stage)
- serve (just run a server without building the project)
